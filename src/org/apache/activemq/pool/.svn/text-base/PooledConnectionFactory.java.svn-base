/**
 * A JMS provider which pools Connection, Session and MessageProducer instances
 * so it can be used with tools like <a href="http://camel.apache.org/activemq.html">Camel</a> and Spring's
 * <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/spring-support.html">JmsTemplate and MessagListenerContainer</a>.
 * Connections, sessions and producers are returned to a pool after use so that they can be reused later
 * without having to undergo the cost of creating them again.
 *
 * b>NOTE:</b> while this implementation does allow the creation of a collection of active consumers,
 * it does not 'pool' consumers. Pooling makes sense for connections, sessions and producers, which
 * are expensive to create and can remain idle a minimal cost. Consumers, on the other hand, are usually
 * just created at startup and left active, handling incoming messages as they come. When a consumer is
 * complete, it is best to close it rather than return it to a pool for later reuse: this is because,
 * even if a consumer is idle, ActiveMQ will keep delivering messages to the consumer's prefetch buffer,
 * where they'll get held until the consumer is active again.
 *
 * If you are creating a collection of consumers (for example, for multi-threaded message consumption), you
 * might want to consider using a lower prefetch value for each consumer (e.g. 10 or 20), to ensure that
 * all messages don't end up going to just one of the consumers. See this FAQ entry for more detail:
 * http://activemq.apache.org/i-do-not-receive-messages-in-my-second-consumer.html
 *
 * Optionally, one may configure the pool to examine and possibly evict objects as they sit idle in the
 * pool. This is performed by an "idle object eviction" thread, which runs asynchronously. Caution should
 * be used when configuring this optional feature. Eviction runs contend with client threads for access
 * to objects in the pool, so if they run too frequently performance issues may result. The idle object
 * eviction thread may be configured using the {@link setTimeBetweenExpirationCheckMillis} method.  By
 * default the value is -1 which means no eviction thread will be run.  Set to a non-negative value to
 * configure the idle eviction thread to run.
